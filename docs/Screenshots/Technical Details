The project follows a layered object-oriented architecture, separating user interface, business logic, and data model layers.

LibrarySystem handles user interaction through a menu-driven console interface.

Library manages core operations such as adding books, registering members, borrowing, returning, and searching books.

Book and Member classes represent real-world entities with private fields and public methods, ensuring proper encapsulation.

Java ArrayList is used to store books, members, and borrowed books, allowing dynamic and flexible data management.

Linear search algorithms are implemented for finding books and members based on ISBN, title, or author.

Validation rules ensure that books can only be borrowed if available and returned only by the borrowing member.

The system uses OOP principles such as encapsulation, abstraction, and modularity to keep the code clean and maintainable.

Time complexity for most operations is O(n) due to list traversal, which is acceptable for small to medium datasets.

The design is scalable and can be enhanced with database integration, GUI, or web-based interfaces in the future.
